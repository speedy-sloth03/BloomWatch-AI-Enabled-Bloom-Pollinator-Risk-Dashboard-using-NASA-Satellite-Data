# BloomWatch Impact Story

## Bangladesh: Empowering Nature, Farmers, and Pollinators

Bangladesh's rich biodiversity and agriculture depend on flower blooms and pollinator health. Climate change, shifting rainfall, and urbanization threaten these cycles.

**BloomWatch** bridges the knowledge gap by using NASA satellites to detect and forecast bloom events, offering vital insights for farmers, conservationists, and policymakers.

- **For Farmers:** Timely bloom forecasts help optimize crop management, reduce risks, and boost yields.
- **For Conservation:** Early warnings aid in protecting habitats and pollinators.
- **For Education:** Interactive maps and dashboards promote climate awareness.

By making high-tech satellite data accessible and actionable, BloomWatch supports sustainable agriculture and biodiversity in Bangladesh.
